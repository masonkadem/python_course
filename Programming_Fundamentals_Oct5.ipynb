        "2. **Design**: Develop a high-level plan for how you'll address the defined problem. This may involve creating architectural designs, user interface layouts, or data models. The goal is to abstractly structure your solution before diving into coding.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Implement**: Write the actual code based on your design. This coding phase includes testing, debugging, and ensuring your code functions correctly. Decomposition is essential here, breaking coding tasks into manageable pieces.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Test**: Thoroughly test your software. It's recommended to test your logic separately from the code to catch and resolve any issues early on. Use the same tests you used during the design phase to validate your programming. Be prepared to repeat the testing step if needed.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **Debug (Optional)**: Sometimes, fixing one issue in your code can introduce new problems. Debugging is the process of identifying and correcting these issues. While not explicitly mentioned, debugging is an inherent part of the implementation and testing phases.\n",
